Basic Overview:

- tablet scans raw point cloud data, ~20,000 points @ 3 fps
- filter these points to remove outliers, then build a voxel map out of them
- send the differences over the network, and incorporate them into our view of the world

  PointCloud voxelworld
  for each frame: 
    PointCloud filteredframe = filterOutliers(frame)
    PointCloud voxelframe = voxelize(filteredframe)
    PointCloud voxeldiffs = diff(voxelframe, voxelworld);
    network.send(voxeldiffs)
    voxelworld.merge(voxeldiffs)
